# Auto Bookmark Classification

![Auto Bookmark Classification](https://github.com/SexyWerewolf/auto-bookmark-classification/blob/main/demo.png?raw=true)

## Overview
**Auto Bookmark Classification** is a Firefox add-on designed to streamline your bookmark management. This tool allows you to automatically classify and save bookmarks into pre-selected folders based on the domain of the website. Say goodbye to cluttered bookmarks and enjoy a more organized browsing experience!

## Features
- **Automatic Folder Assignment**: The addon remembers the folder you choose for a particular domain and automatically selects it the next time you save a bookmark from the same domain.
- **Page Title as Bookmark Name**: Automatically uses the page's title as the name for the bookmark, instead of the URL.
- **Shortcut Key Added**: Added a shortcut key (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to quickly save bookmarks or open the add-on popup if the folder is unknown.

## How It Works
1. **Select a Folder**: When you save a bookmark, choose the desired folder. The addon will remember this folder for the domain.
2. **Save a Bookmark**: The bookmark will be saved with the page title as its name. The next time you save a bookmark from the same domain, the pre-selected folder will be automatically chosen.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/SexyWerewolf/auto-bookmark-classification/releases) from GitHub.
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:addons`.
